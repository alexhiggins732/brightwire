Bright Wire is an open source machine learning library. Includes deep learning (feed forward, convolutional and recurrent), naive bayes, linear regression, decision trees, logistic regression, k-means clustering and dimensionality reduction.

This is the .net standard 2 version of BrightWire, which runs on .net 4.61, .net core 2, xamarin and UWP.

This version does NOT currently support CUDA - which is available via the BrightWire.Net4 and BrightWire.CUDA.Net4.x64 assemblies (which DOES run on Mono).

However, the .net standard version of BrightWire can still execute models trained on the CUDA version.
